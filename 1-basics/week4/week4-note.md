# Trust Essentials

We will define elements of trust in blockchain and discuss the Consensus protocol.

## Learning Objectives

- Define elements of trust in a Blockchain: `security`, `validation`, `verification`, and `consensus`.
- Discuss `Consensus protocol`: an algorithmic approach to add a new block and to secure the chain.
- Explain trust in the robustness of the `main chain`.
- Illustrate trust in managing exceptional situations: `soft fork` and `hard fork`.
- Demonstrate you are able to follow the steps to `transact` on a blockchain.
