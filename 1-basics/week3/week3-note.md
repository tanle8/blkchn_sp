## Quiz Directions

1. Task 1: Computing a block hash (Q2)

    In this task, you are required to compute the block hash for Bitcoin block #490624. You can choose to use the tool we provided or you can manually follow the block hash algorithm as provided on the Bitcoin Wiki (Resource 3), linked above.

    To compute the hash of a block using the Bitcoin Block Hash Calculation tool, open the link provided in the Resource 4 above. Get the details required to compute the block hash by exploring the Bitcoin block #490624 at Resource 1. [Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/), or Resource 2. [Bitcoin Block Explorer](https://blockexplorer.com/).

    Even if you use the tool, it is recommended that you read about the block hashing algorithm using the Bitcoin Wiki website.

2. Task 2: Encrypting and decrypting a message (Q3)

    In this task, you will perform the encryption and decryption of a message using the Resource 5. [Encryption Tool](https://www.cse.buffalo.edu/blockchain/encryption.html) that we have provided. Follow the guidelines in the tool itself to better understand the concept of Public-Private key encryption
