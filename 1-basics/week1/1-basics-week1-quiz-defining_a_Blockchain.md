## Quiz Directions

### Task 1: Understanding the Genesis Block (Q2-Q3)

In this task, you will explore the Genesis blocks (i.e. Block 0), for 2 different implementations of Blockchain, i.e. __Bitcoin Blockchain__ (resource 1 or resource 2) and __Ethereum Blockchain__ (resource 3):

- You need to check the previous `block hash`, `transactions`, and the `reward`.

### Task 2: Exploring a block in the Bitcoin Blockchain (Q4-Q5)

In this task, you will inspect and explore block `#490624` on either _resource 1 or _resource 2_ provided above.

- Locate the hash of this block,
- the hash of the previous block and
- the number of transactions in that block.
- You may explore other things contained in the block as well.
- After this, you will go to the previous block (by block number) and verify the hash of this block is the same as mentioned in the block you were exploring before.
