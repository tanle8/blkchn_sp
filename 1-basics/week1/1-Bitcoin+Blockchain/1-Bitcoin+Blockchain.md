# 1. Bitcoin and Blockchain

what is a blockchain?
Why should you care about it?

Unlike traditional methods, blockchain enables `peer to peer transfer` of `digital assets` without any `intermediaries`. It was a technology originally created to support the famous cryptocurrency, `BitCoin`.

The blockchain by itself has taken a life of its own and permeated a broad range of applications across many industries, including finance, healthcare, government, manufacturing, and distribution.

The blockchain is poised to innovate and transform a wide range of applications, including:

- __Goods transfer__, for example, supply chain.
- __Digital media transfer__, for example, sale of art.
- __Remote services delivery__, example, travel and tourism.
- __Platform for decentralized business logic__, for example, moving computing to data sources
- __Distributed intelligence__, example, education credentialing.

Additional applications of blockchain include:

- __Distributed resources__, for example, power generation and distribution.
- __Crowd funding__ for example, startup fund raising.
- __Crowd operations__, for example, electronic voting.
- __Identity management__, for example, one ID for all your life's functions.
- __Government public records__ and __open governing__.

Moreover, blockchain can enable an `inclusive economy`.

- It can enable a person in a ___remote___ corner of the world to partake in a democratic process. Opportunities for innovative applications are endless. There is a dire need for critical thinkers, designers and developers who can envision and create newer application models on blockchain to benefit the world.

At the end of this course, you will be able to explain the ___three___ fundamental characteristic that define the blockchain using Bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoin is not the only player in town. By the end of the first module, we move beyond Bitcoin into introducing the next generation blockchains with `Ethereum`. You will also be able to discuss the important features of Ethereum blockchain that is used as a reference implementation in many newer blockchains. And explain the algorithms and techniques that enable the blockchain, including a public gate cryptography and hashing. Finally, you will be able to outline methods for realizing trust in a blockchain. [MUSIC] Let's begin with an introduction of Bitcoin. Two major contributions of cryptocurrency Bitcoin are a continuously working digital currency system, and a model for autonomous decentralized application technology called the blockchain. Though our focus is on a general blockchain, we've to understand the working of the technology behind Bitcoin to fully appreciate the innovation of blockchain. We can all agree that the advent of the internet in the world wide web has transformed every aspect of our lives, from stock markets to street corner food trucks. It has enabled a technology explosion with Web 2.0 and the world of e-commerce applications. Around 2008, 2009, when
the institutions and markets we trusted went crumbling down, and everybody was running away from the Wall Street, a mysterious person, or persons,
called Satoshi Nakamoto, introduced a new digital currency, a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. Bitcoin enabled an innovative platform for peer to peer transfer of value without any central authority. With no central authority, how did Bitcoin realize trust and security? By implementing software programs for validation, verification, consensus in a novel infrastructure called the blockchain. Later on in about 2012, 2013, computation elements were added to
the blockchain infrastructure that has opened up a whole world of possibilities beyond simple currency transfer. These innovations are significantly shaping the direction of Web 3.0 as you will
learn in the next four courses. What is a blockchain? Blockchain is about enabling peer to peer
transaction in a decentralized network. Establishing trust among unknown peers. Recording the transaction in
an immutable distributed ledger. Let's understand centralized
versus decentralized network using a common scenario. Consider a scenario where customer wants
to buy an item using her credit card. Let's enumerate the intermediaries
involved in accomplishing this task. We have a credit card agency,
we have a customer bank, we have a credit cards bank,
we have an exchange, we have the merchant's bank,
and finally, the merchant. This is an example of a centralized
system that we are so used to. Now compare this with a system
where peers can transact directly with each other irrespective
of where they are located. Functions of the intermediaries
are shifted to the periphery to the peer participant in
the blockchain infrastructure. Peers are not necessarily
known to each other. This is a decentralized system. How do we establish trust among the peers
in such a decentralized system? By having a process in place to validate,
verify, and confirm transactions. Record the transaction in a distributed
ledger of blocks, create a tamper-proof record of blocks,
chain of blocks, and implement a consensus protocol for agreement on
the block to be added to the chain. So, validation,
verification, consensus, and immutable recording lead to the trust and
security of the blockchain. Now I'll explain these concepts
using another scenario. I'm lending Amy $10,000. This is one single peer
to peer transaction. We both make a note of it on a ledger. What if I change my entry
from 10,000 to 11,000? Alternatively, Amy changes
hers from 10,000 to 1,000. To prevent this trust violation, we need to seek the help of people
around us, Lisa, Allison, and Francis. Provide all of them a valid
copy of this ledger. This is the basic concept of
an immutable distributed ledger defined in a blockchain process. In this scenario, we were all physically
present in one location, Amherst. Now imagine this to be an online
transaction to an unknown peer. Also, scale up the one transaction
to 10,000 transactions, how about a million transactions. I should be able to transact with equal
ease to any unknown peer in Amherst, Albany, or Albania, maybe to send
some flowers to a friend in Albania. This is the tenet of a decentralized
system supported by blockchain. In the case just described,
how do we trust our unknown peers? Through verification and validation. In our example, Amy requests Kevin to
verify the amount I transacted with her. Kevin checks it, oops, Kevin finds the
amount of the transaction is not 10,000, but 300, not valid. Kevin rejects and
nullifies the transaction. Similar to these, validation, then verification methods
devised by the blockchain and implemented by the peers provide the collector
trust needed in a decentralized system. Summarizing, blockchain
technology supports methods for a decentralized peer-to-peer system,
a collective trust model, and a distributed immutable ledger
of records of transactions.
